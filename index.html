<p>These represent some frequently asked questions (FAQs) or important links to understand your pay.  </p>

<h2>General Recommendations</h2>

<p>Many of the aspects of payroll are not automated and mistakes for miscommunication definitely do occur. Although this is not ideal and it may not seem to be the responsibility of the student, I highly recommend you check your bank accounts frequently and check your pay stubs at least once a month.   This will hopefully result in prompt and readily resolution of your problems.  </p>

<h3>Times of most mix-ups</h3>

<p>During academic times during the year, our department says you can work up to 19 hours per week.  If you are on a training grant, that may cover 5 hours per week, thus totaling 14 hours available to work per week.</p>

<p>During nonacademic time such as the summer and winter sessions you can work up to 40 hours per week depending on your training grant or funding situation. As such, positions and payments change frequently during the beginning of the summer the end of the summer beginning of winter session and the end of winter session.  Therefore, you must be vigilant during these times and take extra note of your pay and hours.</p>

<p>First off, go to <a href="http://ssc.jhmi.edu/hr_payroll/deadlines.html">http://ssc.jhmi.edu/hr_payroll/deadlines.html</a> to know when pay periods occur.  There should be the current year and 3 choices:</p>

<ul>
<li>JHU Weekly - these are union workers - not YOU</li>
<li><em>JHU Semi-Monthly</em> - Most JHSPH people (all students, faculty) - this <em>IS YOU</em></li>
<li>JHHS Biweekly - these are hospital workers</li>
</ul>

<p>For 2015, the list is <a href="http://ssc.jhmi.edu/hr_payroll/DataFiles_HR_Payroll/2015_jhu-semi.pdf">here</a>,  The column <em>PAYDAY</em> is when <em>WHEN YOU ARE GOING TO GET PAID</em>.  Depending on direct deposit, you may get the money a day early.  </p>

            </div>
            <div id="hourly_salary" name="hourly_salary" class="panel-collapse collapse ">

                    &lt;!&ndash;/html_preserve&ndash;&gt;</p>

<p>This is one of the most confusing concepts.  Most importantly, at the end of the year <em>YOU WILL GET THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY</em> if you work the same number of hours at a fixed rate.  </p>

<p>Let&#39;s first define some terms.  You will have an hourly <em>rate</em> (or <em>wage</em>) which is how much money you are paid per hour.   I will call hourly vs. salary a payment <em>schedule</em>.   The pay <em>period</em> is when you get paid - which is semi-monthly (twice per month), see the <a href="#payday">payday section</a> for those dates. </p>

<h3>Salary Schedule</h3>

<p>Let&#39;s say you work 10 hours per week on a <em>salary schedule</em> and your rate is <em>$25/hour</em>.  Then, the money you will get per each period 
\[ 
Number of hours/week × wage per hour × 52 weeks / 24 pay periods 
 \]
\[ 
10 hours /week *\$25/hour*52 weeks/24 pay period = \$541.6667 per pay period
 \]</p>

<p>With a <em>salary</em> schedule, you have a fixed number of hours per week and you will be paid the same from this position each pay period.  Note, in the <a href="#payday">payday section</a>, the start and end dates for <em>salary</em> pay coincide with the <em>PAYDAY</em>.  There is only \( 24 \) &ldquo;half-months&rdquo; in a year, so there are only 24 pay periods.  Also note that you make 
\[ 
10 hours /week *\$25/hour*52 weeks = \$13000
 \]
in total that year.   Once you are done a position, <em>YOU MUST TELL YOUR PAYROLL PERSON</em>,  otherwise they may still pay you for that position and you <em>will have to pay that money back</em>! Do not just tell them verbally also get it in writing in e-mail or paper.</p>

<h3>Hourly Schedule</h3>

<p>With an <em>hourly</em> schedule, you must submit time sheets per pay period (or week, depending on the job) and you be paid depending on how many hours worked.  The confusing part is that you may not be paid the same from this position each pay period <em>EVEN IF YOU WORK THE SAME NUMBER OF HOURS</em>.  Why?  In the <a href="#payday">payday section</a>, the start and end dates for <em>hourly</em> pay do not directly coincide with the <em>PAYDAY</em>.  Thus, different number of days are in different pay periods (months are not all even 30 days).  </p>

<p>Again, let&#39;s say you work 10 hours per week on an <em>hourly schedule</em> and your rate is <em>$25/hour</em>.  Then, the money you will get per each period 
\[ 
Number of hours/week × wage per hour × 52 weeks / 26 weeks 
 \]
\[ 
10 hours /week *\$25/hour*52 weeks/26 pay period = \$500 per WEEK
 \]
But again, depending on how that week falls, it may be above or below $500. </p>

<p>The denominator is only \( 26 \), because it is calculated on every 2 weeks and there are \( 52 \) weeks in the year.  Note that you <em>STILL</em> make 
\[ 
10 hours /week *\$25/hour*52 weeks = \$13000
 \]
in total that year if you worked 10 hours each week.   Once you are done a position, you will no longer log hours, and so no payment will be received.  Therefore, you do not have to necessarily tell your payroll person, though I recommend it.</p>

<p>&lt;!&ndash;html_preserve&ndash;&gt;</div> </div> </div>&lt;!&ndash;/html_preserve&ndash;&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;!&ndash;html_preserve&ndash;&gt;<div class="panel panel-default">
            <div class="panel-heading">
                <h4 class="panel-title">
                    <a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#wages">8. Can you have different wages/rates for different jobs?</a>
                </h4>
            </div>
            <div id="wages" name="wages" class="panel-collapse collapse ">
                <div class="panel-body">
                    &lt;!&ndash;/html_preserve&ndash;&gt;</p>

<p>Yes.  Each position (work for person A and person B) can have a different wage/rate.  Ask about this before you start to get paid to expect how much money you will receive.</p>

<p>&lt;!&ndash;html_preserve&ndash;&gt;</div> </div> </div>&lt;!&ndash;/html_preserve&ndash;&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;!&ndash;html_preserve&ndash;&gt;<div class="panel panel-default">
            <div class="panel-heading">
                <h4 class="panel-title">
                    <a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#estimatedTax">9. Do I need to pay estimated taxes during the year?</a>

                    &lt;!&ndash;/html_preserve&ndash;&gt;</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t have any taxes witheld from your paycheck, then probably yes.</p>

<p>At least if you&#39;re an US citizen, you&#39;re supposed to pay estimated taxes on this income on a quarterly basis. In other words, you&#39;re supposed to guess how much you&#39;ll need to pay, and then personally send it in to the IRS and to the state of Maryland. You can&#39;t just keep it or invest it until tax time on April 15.</p>

<p>For quarterly estimated tax deadlines, see below:
&ldquo;Estimated tax payments (Form 1040-ES).   Payments are due on the 15th day of the 4th, 6th, and 9th months of your tax year and on the 15th day of the 1st month after your tax year ends.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.irs.gov/publications/p509/ar02.html">http://www.irs.gov/publications/p509/ar02.html</a> </p>

<p>If you under-estimate the amount you&#39;ll owe in taxes by $500 or more (as I recall), you have to pay interested on the difference. So effectively it might not matter if you just wait until the last quarter and settle up then. However, I like to spread it out over the year, in good faith. I use a quick and dirty online tax estimator to get a ballpark figure for my estimations. You do <em>not</em> need to pay estimated taxes on &ldquo;Salary&rdquo; payments, since those typically <em>do</em> have taxes witheld from them directly. So your estimation should just be based on your fellowship funds or any funds that do not have taxes witheld. </p>

<p>For Maryland taxes, you can do this automatically online, with &ldquo;iFile&rdquo;
<a href="https://interactive.marylandtaxes.com/Individuals/iFile_ChooseForm/default.asp">https://interactive.marylandtaxes.com/Individuals/iFile_ChooseForm/default.asp</a>
(choose form 502D)</p>

<p>For federal taxes, you can schedule payments with the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS)
<a href="https://www.eftps.gov/eftps/login/loginInitial">https://www.eftps.gov/eftps/login/loginInitial</a></p>

<p>With EFTPS, you&#39;ll need to enroll, which is a process that can take a couple of weeks because you need to receive info from them in the mail.</p>
